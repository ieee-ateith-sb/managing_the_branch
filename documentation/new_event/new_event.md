# Organizing new event

Great things can happen when we work together!

This is a guide on how to organize an event as memeber of the IEEE student branch.

If you are not sure about it first of all talk about it and ask for feedback from the other members. IEEE SB members tend to participate to a lot of events and and organize their own. Use their experience! 

From the other hand if you really know what do you want, make sure that you have a solid idea about what you want to present or share

In either case use the #events slack channel to communicate your idea and plans. Remember that together we  can do more!

Things that have to be covered are:

- A solid subject
- A  fine date
- Some space  (preferably free)
- The rest of the  branch is not against it 
- Proper advertisment for the event

Most of our events are taking place at the Sindos capus of IHU, make sure that there are no other events during that date. Also it is a good idea to avoid same dates with major community events 

Members of our student brnach can help you out finding a nice 
room for the even, but remember it's your responsibility

You can ask for help from the design and publication committee for advertisment and posters 

If you want to document what exactly you need, you can use this repository. Open issues and let people assign themselfs

Also make sure that you have available a laptop and proper adaptora (just in case). Again the community can help with that
